---

## [1.3.0] — 2019-01-29

### Added

- Added a quaternary level of colours, per user suggestion, for helping with colour-matched groupings.

---

## [1.2.0] — 2019-01-28

### Added

- Added a comment denoting where user’s pattern code start & ends.
- Add the ability to label a tertiary colour & typeface.

### Changed

- Removed some CSS injection via JavaScript and just wrote it right into the layouts.
- The pattern `width` property is now a `max-width` inside the pattern itself: makes for better media query testing.
- Cleaned up the whitespace in pattern output files.
- Patterns & sample pages are now listed in alphabetical order in the navigation.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where list bullets were being displayed because of user CSS.
- Fixed a bug where internal patterns relied on specific Modulifier features, but user modules didn’t include the feature.
- Made the filename output more reliable with different permalink settings.

### Removed

- Removed the “Show all” button. It was useful previously but I found lots of students don’t really use it properly and it’s a poor user experience.

---

## [1.1.2] — 2019-01-28

### Fixed

- User JS files were included using a `<link>` tag instead of a script tag.

---

## [1.1.1] — 2019-01-28

### Fixed

- The `font_url` was not being loaded into user patterns.

---

## [1.1.0] — 2019-01-26

### Added

- Added class lists for all the Web Dev Tool systems: Gridifier, Typografier & Modulifier.
- Added icons sizes lists for the icons & a code sample of using icons.
- Added the ability specify a code sample form within `config.yml` instead of outputting the pattern include.

### Fixed

- Fix the class names for some of the vertical spacing classes: they didn’t match real Typografier class names.
- Fixed a bug when `<h2>` tags were targetted, the font family in the font display changed incorrectly.
- A pluralization typo in the ModulesProcessor caused a few modules to not display.
- Bold fonts weren’t showing the the typefaces section when there was no `font_url` or it was a browser-safe font.
- Added missing space above `<hr>` that separates the different typefaces.
- Added a cleaner error message when `theme: jekyll_patternbot` wasn’t specified inside the user’s `_config.yml` file.

---

## [1.0.3] — 2019-01-19

### Fixed
